# Customer ↔ Payment (one-to-many)
customer.payments  # All payments by customer
payment.customer   # Customer who made payment

# Invoice ↔ Payment (one-to-many)
invoice.payments   # All payments for invoice
payment.invoice    # Invoice this payment is for

# Order ↔ Payment (one-to-many)
order.payments     # All payments for order

payment.recorded_by  # User who recorded payment
payment.verified_by  # User who verified payment
```

5. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who verified when

**Unverification Workflow**:
1. **Admin Unverifies**: Admin can unverify payments with reason
