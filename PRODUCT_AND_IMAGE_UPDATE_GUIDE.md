# Product and Image Update Guide

## âœ… YES! You can update both product details and images in a single request

The current implementation already supports updating both product information and images in a single API call using the existing `PUT /api/v1/products/{product_id}` endpoint.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Available Endpoints

1. **`PUT /api/v1/products/{product_id}`** - Main product update endpoint
   - Uses `ProductUpdate` schema
   - Supports ALL fields including images
   - âœ… **This is what you want to use for combined updates**

2. **`PUT /api/v1/products/{product_id}/images`** - Image-only update endpoint
   - Uses `ProductImageUpdate` schema
   - Only for image-specific updates
   - Useful when you only want to update images

### ProductUpdate Schema Support

The `ProductUpdate` schema already includes all the fields you need:

```python
class ProductUpdate(BaseModel):
    # Product details
    name: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    base_price: Optional[float] = None
    sku: Optional[str] = None
    brand_id: Optional[int] = None
    category_id: Optional[int] = None
    weight: Optional[float] = None
    dimensions: Optional[str] = None
    is_active: Optional[bool] = None
    is_featured: Optional[bool] = None
    is_discontinued: Optional[bool] = None
    
    # Image fields - ALL SUPPORTED! âœ…
    primary_image_url: Optional[str] = None
    thumbnail_url: Optional[str] = None
    additional_image_urls: Optional[List[str]] = None
```

### Service Layer Support

The `ProductService.update()` method already handles image fields correctly:

```python
def update(db: Session, product_id: int, product_update: ProductUpdate, owner_id: int):
    # Extracts additional_image_urls and handles it properly
    additional_image_urls = update_data.pop('additional_image_urls', None)
    
    # Updates regular fields
    for field, value in update_data.items():
        setattr(db_product, field, value)
    
    # Updates additional image URLs if provided
    if additional_image_urls is not None:
        db_product.set_image_urls(additional_image_urls)
```

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Combined Product and Image Update âœ…

**Request:**
```http
PUT /api/v1/products/123
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-token

{
  "name": "Updated Beauty Product",
  "description": "New description with updated features",
  "base_price": 29.99,
  "weight": 0.15,
  "is_featured": true,
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-thumb.jpg",
  "additional_image_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle2.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/swatch.jpg"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Updated Beauty Product",
  "description": "New description with updated features",
  "base_price": 29.99,
  "weight": 0.15,
  "is_featured": true,
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-thumb.jpg",
  "all_image_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle2.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/swatch.jpg"
  ],
  "display_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Partial Update (Only Some Fields) âœ…

**Request:**
```http
PUT /api/v1/products/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "New Product Name",
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/updated-image.jpg"
}
```

Only the specified fields will be updated, others remain unchanged.

### 3. Image-Only Update (Two Options) âœ…

**Option A - Using main endpoint:**
```http
PUT /api/v1/products/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-thumb.jpg",
  "additional_image_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/new-extra1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/new-extra2.jpg"
  ]
}
```

**Option B - Using dedicated image endpoint:**
```http
PUT /api/v1/products/123/images
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-thumb.jpg",
  "additional_image_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/new-extra1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/new-extra2.jpg"
  ]
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **âœ… Single Request**: Update both product details and images in one API call
2. **âœ… Partial Updates**: Only send the fields you want to change
3. **âœ… Flexible**: Use the main endpoint for combined updates or the image endpoint for image-only updates
4. **âœ… Consistent**: Same response format regardless of which fields you update
5. **âœ… Efficient**: No need for multiple API calls

## Image Handling Features

- **Primary Image**: Main product image (`primary_image_url`)
- **Thumbnail**: Optimized small image (`thumbnail_url`)
- **Additional Images**: Array of extra images (`additional_image_urls`)
- **Computed Properties**: 
  - `all_image_urls`: All images combined
  - `display_image_url`: Best image for display

## Conclusion

**You already have what you need!** ðŸŽ‰

The current implementation fully supports updating both product details and images in a single request using the `PUT /api/v1/products/{product_id}` endpoint with the `ProductUpdate` schema.

No changes are needed to the codebase - this functionality is already implemented and working.
