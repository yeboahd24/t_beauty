# ✅ FIXED: PostgreSQL Array Literal Error

## Problem
When updating a product with `additional_image_urls`, you got this error:
```
malformed array literal: "["https://cdn.example.com/angle1.jpg", ...]"
```

## Root Cause
The service layer was trying to set `additional_image_urls` directly on the Product model, but:
- The model doesn't have an `additional_image_urls` attribute
- It has an `image_urls` attribute that needs JSON serialization
- PostgreSQL was trying to parse the JSON string as an array literal

## The Fix Applied

**File**: `src/app/services/product_service.py`

**Changed**: The `update()` method to properly handle `additional_image_urls`

### Before:
```python
for field, value in update_data.items():
    setattr(db_product, field, value)  # ❌ Could set non-existent field
```

### After:
```python
for field, value in update_data.items():
    if hasattr(db_product, field):  # ✅ Only set existing fields
        setattr(db_product, field, value)
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Prevents Invalid Field Assignment**: Won't try to set `additional_image_urls` on the model
2. **Proper JSON Handling**: Uses `set_image_urls()` method for proper JSON serialization
3. **Database Compatibility**: Stores JSON string in TEXT field, not as PostgreSQL array

## Test Your Fix

Your original request should now work:

```http
PUT /api/v1/products/5
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-token

{
  "name": "Updated Beauty Product",
  "description": "New description with updated features",
  "base_price": 29.99,
  "weight": 0.15,
  "is_featured": true,
  "primary_image_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-primary.jpg",
  "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.example.com/new-thumb.jpg",
  "additional_image_urls": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle1.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/angle2.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/swatch.jpg"
  ]
}
```

## Expected Result

✅ **Success Response**: Product updated with all fields including images
✅ **Database**: JSON string properly stored in `image_urls` column
✅ **API Response**: Complete product object with computed image properties

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- No more PostgreSQL array literal errors
- Proper handling of both product fields and images
- Backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Robust error prevention for future updates
