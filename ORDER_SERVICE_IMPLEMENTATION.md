## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **🔄 Automatic Stock Reduction Flow**
```
1. Create Order (PENDING) → Stock checked but not reduced
2. Confirm Order → Stock automatically reduced + Movement records created
3. Cancel Order → Stock restored (if was confirmed)
4. Complete Order → Stock permanently reduced
```

### **📊 Stock Movement Tracking**
Every order confirmation/cancellation creates detailed audit trails:
- Stock movement records with order references
- Before/after stock levels
- Reason tracking ("Order confirmed: TB-20241215-ABC123")

### **⚠️ Stock Validation**
- **Order Creation**: Validates stock availability
- **Order Confirmation**: Double-checks stock before reduction
- **Insufficient Stock**: Prevents confirmation with detailed error messages
